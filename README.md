**DEPRECATED** - I no longer use Atom and haven't updated in ages. Feel free to fork and take it over if you still use this, otherwise I recommend you use https://github.com/Glavin001/atom-beautify.

---

Run [PHP Code Beautifier](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Fixing-Errors-Automatically) to fix your PHP. Goes well with [linter-phpcs](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-phpcs).

Use the *phpcbf:reformat* command.
